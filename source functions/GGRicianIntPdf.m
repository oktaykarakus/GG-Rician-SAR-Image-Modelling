function ppdf = GGRicianIntPdf(x_range, Alpha, Delta, Gamma)
%% The function for calculating the pdf of GG-Rician intensity.
%  The GG-Rician probability density function for modeling an intensity signal is given below [1]
% 
% $$f_I(\nu|\alpha, \gamma, \delta) = \frac{\alpha^2 }{8\gamma^2\Gamma^2(\frac{1}{\alpha})} 
% \int_0^{2\pi} \exp\left(-\frac{|\sqrt{\nu}\cos\theta - \delta|^{\alpha} + |\sqrt{\nu}\sin\theta - \delta|^{\alpha}}{\gamma^{\alpha}} \right) d\theta$$
%
% INPUTS:
%       ** x_range      : Data values for calculating the pdf
%       ** Alpha        : Shape Parameter.
%       ** Delta        : Location parameter.
%       ** Gamma        : Scale parameter.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       ** ppdf         : The resulting pdf values.
