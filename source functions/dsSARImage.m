function [dsData, dsKL, dsSize] = dsSARImage(dsTargetSize, oneDImage)
%% Code for down-sampling full-size SAR image.
%
% INPUTS:
%       ** dsTargetSize     : Downsampling target sample size.
%       ** oneDImage        : Sorted 1D full-size SAR data.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       ** dsData           : Down-sampled data.
%       ** dsKL             : KL-divergence value between the full-size SAR
%          Image and DSInput. 
%       ** dsSize           : Final down-sampled data size.
%
% OTHER:
%       ** TargetKL         : Target KL-divergence value between the full-size SAR
%          Image and DSInput. Method keeps increasing dsSize until dsKL
%          reaches TargetKL value. Set to 1e-3. Can be replaced with other
%          value if needed.
