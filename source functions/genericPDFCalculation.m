%% The generic function for calculating the pdf of GG-Rician amplitude and intensity.
%
% INPUTS:
%       ** dist         : Refers to the type of simulation.
%                       1: GG-Rician Amplitude modelling of example SAR image.
%                       2: GG-Rician Intensity modelling of example SAR image.
%                       3: GG-Rician Amplitude modelling of synthetically generated data.
%       ** Gamma        : Scale parameter.
%       ** Alpha        : Shape Parameter.
%       ** Delta        : Location parameter.
%       ** x_range      : Data values for calculating the pdf.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       ** ppdf         : The resulting pdf values.
